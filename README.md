# Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment

Personalized Medicine refers to the idea of analyzing an individual patient's tumor to determine what combination of drugs will work best for that paricular individual. For doing this, the thousands of genetic mutation in cancer tumor needs to be distinguished into a. the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) b.the mutation which are neutral and do not contribute to tumor growth (passengers). The interpretation of genetic mutations is being done is currently done manually.

In this project we automate the classification of these drivers from the passengers.

Problem Statement : Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
